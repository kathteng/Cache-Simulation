How to Compile:
Put Main.cpp, Cache.h, Cache.cpp, and the trace files you will use in the same directory.
Since this is in C++, you can compile and run it using an IDE such as Visual Studio, or through the terminal.
When you run Main.cpp, you will be prompted to enter the trace file name, then the parameters for the cache.
